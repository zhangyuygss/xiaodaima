% <<<<<< ABOUT THE WAVELET TOOLBOX'S DIRECTORIES >>>>>>
%
% The main Wavelet Toolbox path is set to '.'  so if you 
% start matlab whithin this directory and the toolbox
% structure is not changed, everything should run fine.
%
% If you're running matlab from any other directory, you
% should have a copy of this 'startup.m' file into your
% starting directory, edit it and change the WAVELET_PATH
% variable to the Wavelet Toolbox's home directory.
%
% The supplied Wavelet Toolbox's directory structure is:
%
%	WAVELET_HOME_PATH           ->	(root directory) 
%                  |____ WVT	    ->	(wavelet transform)
%                  |____ WPACKETS   ->  (wavelet packets)
%		   |____ WFILTER    ->	(filter generation)
%                  |____ SCAL       ->  (scalogram)
%		   |____ WTUTILS    ->	(wavelet utilities)
%		   |____ WPUTILS    ->	(wavelet packet utilities)
%		   |____ WDEMO	    ->	(demo files)
%
% NOTE: If you already have your own startup.m file, you 
% may append it to this one, or simply rename this, for 
% example to WAVSTART.M and execute it when you want the 
% toolbox to become accessable.
%


% --------------------------------------------------------
% Check if toolbox is already installed so as to avoid 
% repeated paths.
% function startup() is declared at the top of the file
% in order to hide WAVELET_HOME_PATH as a global variable
% only. So WAVELET_HOME_PATH is clearable only with 
% CLEAR GLOBAL command.

	disp(' ')
	disp('The Wavelet toolbox paths are already installed.')

	% Any string starting with a 'y' is considered to be 'YES'

%  DOS :    WAVELET_HOME_PATH = 'C:\MATLAB\TOOLBOX\WAVELET';
%  VMS :    WAVELET_HOME_PATH = 'DISKS1:[MATLAB.WAVELET]';

% By default, it is the directory where 'startup.m' is located.

% p=pwd;
WAVELET_HOME_PATH = '/users/wslu/Uvi_Wave.300';   


% --------------------------------------------------------
% Other directories. If the Toolbox's structure is hold
% as it's served, they shouldn't be changed.
%
% But remember to change the syntax according to the machine. 
% (Default settings are for Unix)

WDEMO_PATH     = [WAVELET_HOME_PATH,'/wdemo'];	  % Demo section

   path (path,WPACKETS_PATH)
   path (path,SCAL_PATH)
   path (path,WTUTILS_PATH)

% --------------------------------------------------------
% Now set the default alignment method for transforms.
% See help on WTMETHOD for allowed values on WTCENTERMETHOD.
